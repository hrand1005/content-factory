# content-factory
it's the content factory, what can I say

don't worry if the code is ugly, it's just a prototype :D

Setup:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# set up twitch cli:
brew install twitchdev/twitch/twitch-cli
twitch configure
twitch token

# set up empty files / directories? 
mkdir /db/tmp
touch clips.txt

# set up ffmpeg? install those dependencies?
